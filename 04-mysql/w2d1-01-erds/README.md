# Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

ERD stands for Entity Relationship Diagram. In this stack, we will build our databases ERD-first. An ERD is diagram of the tables in our databases and how they relate to one another.

We will use the MySQL Workbench application to create them.

## Guidelines

1. Make the table name plural and ALL lowercase (ex. `users`, `leads`, `sites`, `clients`, `chapters`, `courses`, `modules`)
2. Use `id` as the primary key - name it id (also make it auto-incremented).
3. Name foreign keys with the singular of your primary keyâ€™s table. (ex: `user_id`, `lead_id`, `site_id`, `client_id`). In Workbench, you should always rename the foreign keys, as the default that MySQL Workbench gives will be plural, (ex. `users_id`)
4. Use `created_at` and `updated_at` as columns for the timestamp in EVERY table you create.

## Data Types
The following are the data types that you will be using 95% of the time. Although there are quite a few other data types that you can use, focus on these for now.

- **`VARCHAR`(number of characters)**
  - Used to store strings of characters as non-numeric values that can be up to 255 characters. It is called a `VARCHAR` because it can store a variable number of characters and will only use the space required for each record that is stored in the database. `VARCHAR` should be used for values with different character lengths like an email, first_name, or last_name.
- **CHAR(number of characters)**
  - Also used to store characters as non-numeric values, however, it will use up all space for the set number of characters regardless of what value is added. For instance, if I set `CHAR(15)`, and I try to store the value "Coding", it will use up the equivalent of 15 characters even though "Coding" is only 6 characters long. `CHAR` is good to use for things that will always be a given number of characters. Char would work well for something like a `state_abbreviation`.
- **INT**
  - Used to store integers.
  - The columns that you will find mostly using the `INT` are things like a unique identifier for each table. The majority of rows in a table will not exceed 2.1 billion records. `INT` is good to use for most normal number values like a phone_number or a zip_code.
  - *unsigned* (positive numbers only) - can store numerical values from 0 up to 4294967295
  - *signed* (positive and negative numbers) - can store numerical values from -2147483648 up to 2147483647
- **`BIGINT`**
  - BIGINT would be used for columns that would need to store huge numbers. In most cases, you wouldn't need `BIGINT`, but if you wanted to store something like a Facebook id when using Facebook's API, since they have over a billion users the id will need to be a data type of `BIGINT`.
  - *unsigned* (again positive numbers only) - can store numerical values from 0 up to 18446744073709551615
  - *signed* (positive and negative numbers) - can store numerical values from 9223372036854775807 to -9223372036854775808.
- **TINYINT**
  - MySQL stores boolean data types as `TINYINT`s. 0 is considered false and 1 is considered true.
  - `TINYINT` would be good to use for numbers that will be relatively small. A good example of something that would use a `TINYINT` is user level identifier (0 - inactive user, 1 - active user, 9 - admin).
  - *unsigned* - can store numerical values from 0 up to 255
  - *signed* - can store numerical values from -128 up to 127
- **FLOAT**
  - Used to store floating point numbers (numbers that need to have decimal places). An example column for this would be like an `item_cost`.
- **TEXT**
  - Used to store a large amount of text, like a description, message, or comment. Use this for any text that `VARCHAR()` is too small to handle.
- **DATETIME**
  - Used for time-stamps, like created_at and updated_at, or to store a date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`
- **DATE**
  - Used for storing general dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example, a birthdate.
